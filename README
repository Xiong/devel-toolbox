Devel-Toolbox version v0.0.0
*** NONFUNCTIONAL ***

The computer should be doing the hard work. 
That's what it's paid to do, after all.
    -- Larry Wall

Perl developers are offered a range of machinery with which to carry out 
various tasks not strictly part of writing production code: starting a new 
project, starting new modules, testing (testing testing), building a CPAN 
distribution, uploading, and so forth. These machines range from simple 
and quaint to modern and enormous. 

Devel::Toolbox steers a middle course; it attempts to offer more utility 
for less investment. We assume that you would rather make your project 
work than learn how your toolbox works; and you may not need great power 
to do that.
